# Retail-Data-Analysis
This project analyzed retail transaction data containing over 6,000 records across products, sales channels, discounts, and geographic regions. Due to data quality challenges such as missing values, inconsistent formatting, and invalid pricing, the dataset was first cleaned and standardized using SQL to ensure analytical reliability.
